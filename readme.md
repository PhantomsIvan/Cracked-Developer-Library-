# The Wild Wild West 


## Intro
Books i want to have notes and flash cards on maybe even produce some kind of book report

Various books are tagged by a Harvard CS subject they might be related to because it's so easy to find syllabus information on Harvard courses if not complete slide decks for that whole semester.
